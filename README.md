# Fuzzy_logic_BLDC_Motor-
Fuzzy Logic Speed Control of BLDC Motor using MATLAB Simulink  Developed a fuzzy logic-based speed control system for a BLDC motor using MATLAB Simulink. Implemented membership functions and rules to adjust motor speed based on input variables. Conducted simulations to optimize fuzzy logic parameters and validate system performance.
